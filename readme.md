## Welcome to RER!

The **RER** (Rural Environmental Registry — Digital Public Good) is a modern, comprehensive solution for managing rural environmental registrations, developed as a digital public good. This project provides a robust and scalable architecture for systems that register rural land properties with support for geospatial data.

The solution is a technological platform that modernizes and expands the capabilities of the Rural Environmental Registry (CAR) by transforming it into a Digital Public Good (DPG). This approach aims to meet Brazil's specific needs while enabling replication in international contexts, promoting the interoperability and flexibility required for adapting to different legal frameworks, cultural requirements, and local realities.

Based on open-source technologies, the solution will be modular, scalable, and interoperable, and will include:

- An administrative portal for configuration and management
- A portal for registration of properties and landowners
- Robust geospatial tools

The system is designed to provide a range of innovative features, particularly a highly efficient geospatial engine that enables real-time processing and analysis of spatial data. This engine facilitates visualization and decision-making in multiple areas, such as urban planning and environmental monitoring. It serves as the core module of the CAR DPG and will be implemented as an evolution of the geospatial engine currently used by SICAR.

The solution will support multiple languages, ensuring global accessibility and adaptability to local user needs, regardless of region. Additionally, the system will be structured using microservices, ensuring greater flexibility, scalability, and ease of maintenance, allowing each component to operate independently and be updated or replaced without impacting the overall system.

The use of building blocks — a standard concept in DPGs — allows for the creation of customized solutions and integration with other platforms, providing a modular and reusable approach. This also enables components to be replaced with other technologies better suited to each country’s reality. Finally, the DPG philosophy requires the system to be made available as open-source software, ensuring full transparency regarding implementation and allowing users and developers to collaborate, customize, and continuously improve its functionalities. This approach supports ongoing innovation and integration with the global developer community, which will be fostered and encouraged by the Brazilian government.

## Project Organization

RER is organized as a main project with multiple Git submodules, each responsible for a specific system functionality:

### Subprojects Structure

- [**`backend/`**](https://github.com/Rural-Environmental-Registry/backend) - Main backend built with Spring Boot and PostGIS support for managing property, person, and related attribute records. It provides a complete REST API with Swagger documentation.

- [**`frontend/`**](https://github.com/Rural-Environmental-Registry/frontend) - Modern web interface developed in Vue.js 3 with Vite, offering a responsive and intuitive user experience for rural environmental data registration and visualization.

- [**`map_component/`**](https://github.com/Rural-Environmental-Registry/map_component) - Interactive map library for Vue 3, based on Leaflet, providing the dpg-mapa component with support for multiple layers, drawing tools, and event handling.

- [**`authentication/`**](https://github.com/Rural-Environmental-Registry/authentication) - Authentication and authorization system based on Keycloak with PostgreSQL, including an administrative frontend and backend for user and permission management.

- [**`calc_engine/`**](https://github.com/Rural-Environmental-Registry/calc_engine) - Calculation engine for geospatial data processing and environmental analysis, developed in Java with support for complex geoprocessing operations.

- [**`Gateway/`**](https://github.com/Rural-Environmental-Registry/gateway) - API Gateway based on Spring Cloud Gateway for intelligent routing between different microservices, including load balancing and proxy configuration.

## System Configuration Overview

RER offers a centralized functionality for viewing all configurations applied to the different submodules of the project. This provides great transparency and facilitates debugging, allowing administrators and developers to quickly verify the values ​​of environment variables, compilation settings, and parameters defined in various files.

### Page Access

The view page can be accessed in the **`Authentication`** submodule interface.

1. **Access the URL:** The `Authentication` administration application is available at `http://localhost/<BASE_URL>/<AUTHENTICATION_FRONTEND_CONTEXT_PATH>`.

> The variables `<BASE_URL>` and `<AUTHENTICATION_FRONTEND_CONTEXT_PATH>` are defined in the environment's [configurations](config/Main/environment/.env.example).

2. **Log in** with the following default administrator credentials:

- **Username:** `admin-cardpg@gmail.com`

- **Password:** `NovaSenhaForte123!`

After logging in, the settings table will be displayed.

### How it Works

The functionality is orchestrated by several key components:

1. **Display Interface (`Authentication/frontend/src/views/AdminSettings.vue`)**: A page in the `Authentication` frontend that retrieves and displays the settings in a searchable table.

2. **Frontend Data Collection (`frontend/scripts/generate-config.sh`)**: This script runs during the `frontend` build process and collects information from files such as `.env`, `package.json`, and map configurations, consolidating them into a `config.json` file that is served statically.

3. **Backend Endpoint (`backend/src/main/java/br/car/registration/controller/AdminController.java`)**: Exposes an endpoint (`/v1/admin/app-info`) that provides server-side configurations, such as application properties (`application.properties`), environment variables, and default system attributes.
4. **Configuration Parser (`Authentication/frontend/src/helpers/table.ts`)**: A helper in the `Authentication` frontend that interprets data received from frontend and backend endpoints, identifying the source of each configuration for display in the interface.

### How to Modify Configurations

Changes should be made directly to the source files of each submodule. The table on the administration page indicates the "component" (submodule) and the "source" (file or mechanism) of each configuration.

Below are some practical examples:

| Configuration | Source | Submodule | How to Change |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------------- | :-------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `frontend_project_name` | `package.json` | `frontend` | Change the `name` field in the `frontend/package.json` file. |
| `backend_url` | `.env` | `frontend` | Modify the `VITE_CARDPG_URL` variable in the `frontend/.env` file. |
| `default_language` | `src/config/languages.json` | `frontend` | Adjust the `defaultlanguage` key in the `frontend/src/config/languages.json` file. |
| `application_name` | `application.properties` | `backend` | Change the `spring.application.name` property in `backend/src/main/resources/application.properties`. |
| `frontend_urls` | `docker-compose.yaml` | `backend` | Define the `FRONTEND_URLS` environment variable in the corresponding service. |
| `fields.person` | `database` (hardcoded) | `backend` | Modify the `getDefaultAttributes()` method in `AdminController.java`. |

This approach ensures that each submodule remains self-contained in its settings, while providing a unified view for system administration.

### Data Flow

1. **User** → **frontend** (web interface)
2. **frontend** → **gateway** (HTTP requests)
3. **gateway** → **microservices** (intelligent routing)
4. **authentication** ↔ **keycloak** (login/authorization)
5. **backend** ↔ **PostgreSQL** (registration data)
6. **calc_engine** → **calculations** (geoespacial processing)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Ports in Use

```bash
# Check for ports in use
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep :8080
```

#### Docker Permission Issues

sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker

# Restart Docker if needed
sudo systemctl restart docker
```
